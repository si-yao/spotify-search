Instruction to run:
Under the folder Part_2, open index.html by a modern browser (Chrome). All dependencies are attached in the same folder, no need to download any. To use the app, type song name in the main input box, and search. Also, click “Advanced” button to show advanced search options. After search, by clicking at one of the album photo, the preview track will be played with animation. And at the bottom, there are previous and next button to go to previous page and next page.

Compatibility:
I tested the app on Chrome Version 45.0.2454.101 (64-bit) and Safari Version 9.0 (10601.1.56.2).

Design Decisions:
1.  At the top of the page, I put three lines to describe the functionality and use case of the web page. So this design decision follows the usability heuristic, help and documentation, to help new user quickly get familiar with the web page.
2.  Below is a search bar. User can search song name in the main search box and click search. Also, user can click “Advanced” button to do an advanced search, searching by artist, album, etc. By clicking “Advanced”, detailed search boxes will slide down. By clicking it again, detailed search boxes will slide up and disappear. This design decision follows the usability heuristic, aesthetic and minimalist design, that keep things simple and relevant. This design also follows usability heuristic, flexibility and efficiency of use, that is good for use for both new user and experienced user. New user can search songs just by name, and experienced user can search by more criteria. 
3.  After search, a list of songs will be displayed below. And the corresponding album photo will also be displayed in a rounded shape. By clicking each song, the preview will be played, and the rounded photo will start rotating. This UI decision follows the usability heuristic, match between system and the real world. The rounded photo looks like a music CD, and CD rotates when songs are played. Also the rotation animation follows the rule, visibility of system status. User knows which song is played by seeing the rotating animation. 
4.  In addition, some minor things need to be noticed. User search songs by advanced search box, and then hide the box. Next time user clicks the “Advanced” button, the input history is still there. That follows the rule, recognition rather than recall. The page records user’s input to minimize their memory load. And also when user search by year, and type an invalid input, for example typed something that is not a number, then the page will alter user that the input is invalid and ignore the year field. This design follows the rule, error prevention and help users recognize, diagnose, and recover from errors. 
5.  User control and freedom comes to the app in nature. User can search everything they want, and search again and again. And can play any songs in the list, and can go to the previous page and next page.
